# Introduction

One of the behaviors that has served humanity rather well is our tendency to band together to fight against common threats. Over the last few centuries this skill has admittedly atrophied a bit. But just about any story of monsters, aliens, robotic-overlords bent on harming humanity usually sees this practice revived and exercised to great effect. After all, it seems it's in our nature.

But if that's true why don't we make (good, productive) use of that skill more often?

Case in point: ***Bugs***.

No I'm not talking about common insects. Nor am I talking about the giant ones of [B-movie SciFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers_\(film\)) plots either. Instead I'm referring to a much more prevalent (and arguably insidious) kind: [software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug).

In many organizations, software bugs are not given the attention they merit. This is particularly true when the source of the bug is not clear, nobody wants to admit having caused it, and everyone is loathe to accept the responsibility of claiming and fixing it.

But what if these bugs actually were real life monstrosities? I can guarantee we would take a much different view of them, and...sooner or later...exercise that reflexive skill that is our trademark.

So why don't we try it?

# Overview
This project attempts to trick users into taking a more proactive approach to:

 - finding
 - fixing
 - preventing (through defensive practices)

 software bugs by gamifying these activities.

## Concepts

`TODO`

- name

- tag (link to issue in your issue tracker)

- origin (team, area of code, department, etc.)

- scope (who it effects and how)

- size

- severity

- slaying (fixing the bug)
  - bounties

- traps (preventing the bug - or ones like it - from reoccurring again)

- detecting (creatures spawning in your kingdom)

- defenses (protect your kingdom from outside threats)
